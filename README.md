The provided Python code is a web scraping script designed to extract information about tables listed on eBay. It utilizes the `requests` library to fetch the HTML content of the eBay page for tables and `BeautifulSoup` for parsing the HTML. The script then identifies relevant elements on the webpage, such as product names, prices, shipping costs, image URLs, the number of watchers, and product conditions, using specific HTML tags and class names. The extracted data is then organized and written to a Tab-Separated Values (TSV) file named `tableList.tsv` using the `csv` module. Each row in the TSV file corresponds to a table listing, and the columns include details such as product name, price, shipping cost, image URL, number of watchers, and product condition. The script is structured to handle cases where the information for a particular element might be missing, ensuring that the output file remains well-structured.# data-scraping
